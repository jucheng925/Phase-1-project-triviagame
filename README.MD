[GITHUB REPOSITORY]: A well-written informative README.md file. This is the business card of your project and you really want it to look great! A template can be found here: makeareadme.com *Links to an external site*.. 

Some additional considerations:
If you used someone else's pictures or material please make sure you give them credit in your README.
If you think your blog post and/or video are really good and would add value, add them to your README.md.
If you want to go above and beyond, record a few seconds of yourself navigating the app and turn it into a gif. Then, add the gif in your README.md. That way anyone can get a sense of how your app works without leaving the README's page on GitHub!
